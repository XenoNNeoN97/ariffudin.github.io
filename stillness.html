                    <span class="card-subtitle01">Stillness is a meditation app that teaches mindfulness techniques as well as self-care techniques. It was created for both iOS and Android smartphones, according to Google and Apple's respective style rules. The software makes good use of iconography, colour, and visual design.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">There are a number of meditation apps available on the App Store and Google Play Store, but from my experince there is very little content for users who do not pay for the services, which can be costly monthly subscriptions. I decided I wanted to create an app which provide a free 
                  library of meditation audio clips that could be used by both Android and I phone users. Both versions of the app would need to follow the distinct brand style guides to provide familiarity to the two diffrent user groups.

                <span class="card-subtitle02">With an emphasis on UI for this project, 
                  I covered the following phases in my design process: user stories, 
                  proto personas, user flows, sketching, wireframing, style guides, 
                  and prototyping.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I undertook this project as part of the Google UI UX course to develop my skill as a UI UX designer. The project brief was to create an app of my choice, but it needed to have both an iOS and Android version. As an advocate for meditation and self-care I decided it would be a greate subject for my app. </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">1. Research Mobile Platforms</span>
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  To begin with I had to study the design guidelines for both Apple and Android devices, to see how they construct and style mobile apps. I looked at Android's Material Design Guidelines and the Human Interface Guidelines for iOS. I now know precisely which typefaces, icons, colour palettes and UI elements each operating system currently uses 
                  to style their apps and how they implement all these components to create products which always feel familiar to their users. With this, I began to consider what the necessary design diffrences would be for the two variations of the Stillness app.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">2. Competitor Analysis</span>
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  The most popular meditation apps for both devices are currently Headspace and Calm. Before thinking of features for my own app it was important to look at these competitors to see what they provided users, how easy were they to navigate and was anything missing which my product could offer?
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Both apps provided extensive libraries of meditions as well as a range of other services, such as fitness and music features. However, users could only access the large majority of this content if they had a paid subscription. The free to use content was incredibly limited and this was the gap I aimed to fill.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">3. User Flow Diagram</span>
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Before I began designing the screens for the app I created a user flow digram in Adobe XD to map out which screens need to be included and how users would navigate between them, This diagram would work as an initial blueprint for which features would be available within the app and how many screens I would need to design.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">4. Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</span>
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Now I had an idea for what I wanted my app to be, and understood the diffrent requirements for iOS and Android, I stared creating mid-fidelity wireframes with Adobe XD which would demonstrate the basic app layout.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  For this particular project this involved downloading the curent UI tool kits for Android and iOS so I would be able to properly implement device specific UI elements and patterns, such as keyboards, typefaces and buttons.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  For what I wanted to achive the app would function the same way on Android and iOS and the only visual diffrences would be how elements display on the two screen sizes.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">5. Mobile Gesttures</span>
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Once I finished the mid-fidelity wireframes, I labelled the screens with icons which explained how the user would be able to interactive with the design. The gestures consisted of standard interaction such as taps, scrolls and swipes.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  This procedure would be important if I were working on this app with other designers or sending it to developers, wo they could easily understand how the roduct would work.

                  After looking at Headspace and Calm I knew I wanted my app to have a minisde

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I then determined which features the app would require in order to be successful and useful. 
                  I also made a user flow diagram to map out these features and determine what type of pages the app would require.</span>

                  I then went on to Figma for my mid-fidelity wireframes, where I designed the initial mobile platform layouts.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I made a style guide to show and instruct others on the final choices

                  It is critical to determine whether the app's flows and visual design are appealing to consumers. 
                  I'd also like to identify where there are opportunities for improvement, as iterations are an essential 
                  part of the design process.</span>
