                  To gather insights on the user experience of the Alphacore websites and other IT solutions services in the same domain, I employed two research methods: competitive analysis and user interviews. Through a competitive analysis, I examined the strengths and weaknesses of the Alphacore websites in comparison to their counterparts. Additionally, user interviews provided valuable firsthand feedback, enabling me to understand the perspectives and needs of users when interacting with these websites.

                  I began by analyzing competitors in the IT solutions industry to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and similar capabilities. During this analysis, I discovered that the Alphacore websites shared several components with the other competitor website, which served as an inspiration for the client. These components proved to be valuable and could be effectively utilized in the redesign of the Alphacore websites, enhancing their overall functionality and user experience.

                  Now that I had gained a deeper understanding of the competitors, my next objective was to assess the user experience of the current Alphacore websites. To achieve this, I conducted five usability tests with users, aiming to gather valuable insights into their experiences while navigating the Alphacore websites. These tests provided firsthand feedback on the usability, intuitiveness, and overall satisfaction of users when interacting with the website. The findings from these usability tests would serve as crucial input for identifying areas of improvement and enhancing the user experience on the Alphacore websites.

                  Although I had the opportunity to interview several current users of Alphacore's IT solutions services, I encountered challenges in gathering participants outside of the Alphacore community due to time constraints and conflicting schedules.

This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of user needs and preferences, enabling us to create a more inclusive and user-centric website experience.

I believe there are several areas that could benefit from enhancements, such as optimizing the websites to improve their selling potential and refining user and task flows. By addressing these aspects, we can create a more streamlined and visually cohesive experience for visitors to the Alphacore websites, leading to heightened satisfaction and engagement, ultimately translating into increased conversions and success for the business.
