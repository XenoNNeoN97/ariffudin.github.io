                        Kento Kanemoto, the representative director of HEART SHAKER, created a Q&A community where people help each other. They established the world's first community of its kind and found that expressing gratitude motivates people to assist others. To spread gratitude, they formed the HEART SHAKER association, aiming to enlighten appreciative individuals and promote a grateful world. Their focus is on discovering, recognizing, and sharing gratitude-inspiring individuals, companies, and organizations.

However, all of these websites are very specific to tv shows, books or movies only.  Tehre is no one solution to track all entertainment.

                  Once the brand style and UI library was created, I turned the low fidelity wireframes into a high fidelity prototype.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">There are two item exchange modes in Swaapie. The first is one on one matching. As long as two users like each other's item, the system would match them. After matching successfully, the users can use the chat room function to discuss the details of the items and use the calendar function to determine the time of offline appointment. The second one is the group swapping. In group swapping mode, a user could use their own created items to apply to join the group as long as they see a group they are interested in. Once the group's creators agree, the user can join the group successfully.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">We believe that each used item can only represent a story, a unique background context. The story can not be copied and recreated. As a consequence, in Swaapie, it’s a limitation that once an item is successfully matched, the same item can no longer be matched with other users unless users cancel this match.
                </span>

                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">Once you drag the item to the center of the screen in one on one matching mode, you can start matching. In this mode, there are four functional buttons. The ”X” symbol represents “dislike this item”, “heart-shaped” symbol is on behalf of “like this item”. The left most of is the ”Rewind” button, the far right is the “Super-Like” button.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">Matches would occur only if two users like each other’s item. Before math happens, users wouldn’t know who likes their items. However, if you see some- thing really attracts you, you can use the Super-Like to enhance the chance the of matching successfully. Once you click Super-Like to something you really like, the system would send a notification to the owned user.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">While browsing the items, there are accidentally mistakes. For example, users may accidentally click the item they like to “dislike”. Rewind function could help return the previous item in order to address this problem.
