                        Kento Kanemoto, the representative director of HEART SHAKER, created a Q&A community where people help each other. They established the world's first community of its kind and found that expressing gratitude motivates people to assist others. To spread gratitude, they formed the HEART SHAKER association, aiming to enlighten appreciative individuals and promote a grateful world. Their focus is on discovering, recognizing, and sharing gratitude-inspiring individuals, companies, and organizations.

                  To better comprehend user concerns, I embarked on a research journey that began with an in-depth review of academic literature related to comparable applications. Furthermore, I carefully analyzed user feedback on the Play Store and closely examined recorded Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions featuring current Hear Shaker users.  This extensive investigation revealed several identified issues, such as insufficient progress information, limited access to campaign post, the incapacity to select preferred campaign updates, a lack of transparency concerning contribution and gratitude tokens (TKU), and the absence of rewarding features, among other challenges.

                  - Simplify the contributor's disbursement of contributions

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  However, I didn't discard other solutions but instead grouped them into an affinity diagram to complement the application's performance, encompassing social features, wishlists, reward programs, and future features.

                  I also conducted user testing to confirm pain points after redesigning the Heart Shaker application's user interface. Using the depth interview method, I asked several questions related to whether there were any obstacles or confusion with the design I had created. Here are the results of user interviews for each task we assigned:
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Task 1 (Login): There are no issues to report, and the information provided is straightforward and easy to understand.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Task 2 (Contribution): There are no issues to report, and the information provided is straightforward and easy to understand.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Task 3 (Photo/Video Campaign and Story): Quite interested in the new feature because it makes it easier for users who don't have much time to read. It's simpler. Viewing stories also minimizes user time usage. Information about disbursement and allocation is clear enough.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Task 4 (Bookmark): No issues, but slightly confusing because there is no next step. Information is somewhat lacking because users cannot see whether there is a difference in the bookmarked information or not.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Task 5 (sending personalized video/photo thank-you messages): No issues, there have been some updates so users can see detailed information; this innovation is helpful for users.
                </span>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Overall, users rated it as 6 on a scale of 1–7 (PASSED).
