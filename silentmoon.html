                    <span class="card-subtitle01">SilentMoon is a meditation app that teaches mindfulness techniques as well as self-care techniques. It was created for both iOS and Android smartphones, according to Google and Apple's respective style rules. The software makes good use of iconography, colour, and visual design.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">There are a number of meditation apps available on the App Store and Google Play Store, but from my experince there is very little content for users who do not pay for the services, which can be costly monthly subscriptions. I decided I wanted to create an app which provide a free 
                  library of meditation audio clips that could be used by both Android and I phone users. Both versions of the app would need to follow the distinct brand style guides to provide familiarity to the two diffrent user groups.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I undertook this project as part of the Google UI UX course to develop my skill as a UI UX designer. The project brief was to create an app of my choice, but it needed to have both an iOS and Android version. As an advocate for meditation and self-care I decided it would be a greate subject for my app. </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  To begin with I had to study the design guidelines for both Apple and Android devices, to see how they construct and style mobile apps. I looked at Android's Material Design Guidelines and the Human Interface Guidelines for iOS. I now know precisely which typefaces, icons, colour palettes and UI elements each operating system currently uses 
                  to style their apps and how they implement all these components to create products which always feel familiar to their users. With this, I began to consider what the necessary design diffrences would be for the two variations of the SilentMoon app.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  The most popular meditation apps for both devices are currently Headspace and Calm. Before thinking of features for my own app it was important to look at these competitors to see what they provided users, how easy were they to navigate and was anything missing which my product could offer?
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Both apps provided extensive libraries of meditions as well as a range of other services, such as fitness and music features. However, users could only access the large majority of this content if they had a paid subscription. The free to use content was incredibly limited and this was the gap I aimed to fill.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Before I began designing the screens for the app I created a user flow digram in Adobe XD to map out which screens need to be included and how users would navigate between them, This diagram would work as an initial blueprint for which features would be available within the app and how many screens I would need to design.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Now I had an idea for what I wanted my app to be, and understood the diffrent requirements for iOS and Android, I stared creating mid-fidelity wireframes with Adobe XD which would demonstrate the basic app layout.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  For this particular project this involved downloading the curent UI tool kits for Android and iOS so I would be able to properly implement device specific UI elements and patterns, such as keyboards, typefaces and buttons.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  For what I wanted to achive the app would function the same way on Android and iOS and the only visual diffrences would be how elements display on the two screen sizes.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Once I finished the mid-fidelity wireframes, I labelled the screens with icons which explained how the user would be able to interactive with the design. The gestures consisted of standard interaction such as taps, scrolls and swipes.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  This procedure would be important if I were working on this app with other designers or sending it to developers, wo they could easily understand how the roduct would work.

              <span class="card-subtitle01">I continued to use Figma to create my high-fidelity wireframes and an 
                interactive prototype.</span>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  After looking at Headspace and Calm I knew I wanted my app to have a minimalist design with nature imagery, to give user an environtment that felt inviting, safe and easy to navigate. It was very important to provide users with a stress free and intutive interface.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  I experimented with a couple of visual styles before arriving at a simple but calming colour palette, the sans serif font Poppins and vector graphic versions of natural landscapes for the app's imagery. I created the high-fidelity wireframes in Figma and used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to edit the images.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  With these design I produced working prototypes, again in Figma, for both versions of the app.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  I recruited a handful of participants to user test the prototypes. Android user commenting on the Android version and those with IPhones experiencing the iOS version.
                  It was important that the participant had prior experience with the chosen operating system so they could comment on the familiarity of each design. If someone was unfamiliar with the operating system they may comment on features which were outside of my control.
                  I asked each of them to explore the app and to let me know what they tought of the navigation, layout and visual design.
                  The feedback I recived was overall very positive, many stating they really liked the imagery and colour palette.

                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  Although the feedback was predominantly encouraging, there was a couple of areas which needed to be worked on. Primarily, there was no logo for the app anywhere in the design and the name was only mentioned in the notifications massage. The app was originally called Care, but this was deemed a bit generic by some of the user testing participants, so I decided to chage the name to SilentMoon.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  After deciding on a new app name, I designed a few possible logo options in Adobe Illustrator, most of wich having some relation to the natural world to match the imagery of the app. The chosen logo has a simpler typeface design but still resembles nature. The letters on the second row are transparent, in an attempt to seem like a reflaction of the first row, similarly to seem like a reflection of the first row, similarly to the way water reflects its surroundings.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  When I started this project, I aimed to deisgn a meditation app which was easy to understand and accessible to both Android and iOS users, and the product has achieved these goals. Both versions of the app provide familiarity to users, are easy to navigate and look visually appealing.

               <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  The biggest challenge for me was deciding on a visual style for the SilentMoon app. I experimented with a number of diffrent styles but many of them did't quite match the content of the app or the environtment I wanted to create for the users.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                  I liked the idea of the app having an abstract art design, but the imagery of mountains, lakes and night skies definitley felt more relevent.
