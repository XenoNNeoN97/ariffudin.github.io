                <span class="card-subtitle01">I started the inspiration phase of my process by conducting market 
                    research and competitor analysis to better understand who my competitors were and what they

                    to my app. This meant that the potential for RenoMaven was huge. However, this was also its biggest 
                    risk (i.e. Why wasn’t there another app like this already?). I sought to overcome this risk by seizing 
                    the opportunity and creating an app users didn’t know they needed.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">My findings also helped me shape my problem statement and possible solutions. My original problem 
                    statement has remained consistent throughout the app’s development, though the solutions have changed 
                    slightly as I’ve progressed.</span>

                    users’ needs, goals, and points of friction.  I asked questions focused on users' experiences with home 
                    renovation. I then analyzed my users' answers by sorting them into an affinity map to gain overarching insights.

                <span class="card-subtitle01"> The user research helped me confirm or revise my possible solutions and user 
                    stories. From there, I decided to create the app with the following main functions:</span>

                    representation of the screens and how they relate to each other. I used Optimal Sort to conduct an open 
                    card sort with five participants.</span>

                    <span class="card-subtitle01">The results indicated that I needed combine the Chats and Calls functions 
                        under one umbrella function, which I then named Connect. I also renamed Chats to Messages after some

                    I moved on to Adobe XD for my mid- and high-fidelity wireframes. Throughout the different fidelity stages, 
                    continuous iterations were made to improve the app’s functionality and UX.</span>

                    to gain a lot of valuable insights. Using my findings from the tests, I created an affinity map to analyze the results 
                    and a rainbow spreadsheet to map out and prioritize the errors that occurred during testing.</span>

                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">I revised my prototype and asked peers from CareerFoundry’s online community to conduct a peer 
                    review so that I could gain further suggestions and comments for improvement. Asking other UX-minded people for critique 
                    helped me confirm or revise big and small elements of my app, making the next iteration even better. </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">Notable updates included:
                    1)   REPLACING THE FILTER MODAL BOXES with filter pills and chips for the Search Topics and Find Experts screens. Because 
                    there aren’t too many filter options, pill and chips that are visible under the search bar may make more sense than a modal 
                    box that appears by tapping on a filter icon.</span>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">2)   REMOVING THE SEARCH BAR on the Calls tab in the Connect screens. Theoretically, an upcoming 
                    call would disappear once the call has happened. Therefore, there wouldn’t be enough calls listed to warrant a search bar 
                    necessary. </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                    I used real images and pops of color to engage users and get them excited about home projects. I wanted the images to be 
                    aspirational, yet approachable, to show users possibilities that were attainable. The images also showcased a wide variety of 
                    styles at different price points to ensure that the app was appealing to different users’ styles and budgets.</span>

                    The app’s main colors were blue and green. The blues, Ocean and Sky, evoked calmness and productivity—two feelings helpful in 
                    any home project. The greens, Jade and Aqua, stood for trust and acceptance, as if to say, “Trust RenoMaven to give you the best answer.”</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                    For the typography, I used Nothing You Could Do, a handwritten font, to give the app a sense of approachability. For all other 
                    text, I used Nunito, a sans serif font, to ensure legibility.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01"> 
                    I kept the icons clean and simple, and for the most part, I used universal icons. There were some instances where I combined two universal icons to 
                    create a new, unique icon for the app (e.g. the Connect icon). There were also cases where the icon's function, might not be obvious at first glance 
                    (e.g. the Search Topics, Ask Questions, and Find Expert icons). However, with the new and improved onboarding, the user will learn early on what they mean.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01"> 
                    Though I was more drawn to creating wireframes and prototypes, I found that the most important part of the process was testing. For example, usability 
                    testing was crucial in finding errors and seeing things from a different perspective. The biggest error occurred with the onboarding process, which many 
                    of my participants skipped because they thought was too long. However, skipping the onboarding caused the participants to have a harder time completing 
                    the tasks I asked them to do. In my next iteration, I redid the onboarding to strike a balance between what my participants wanted and what they needed.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01"> 
                    Based on feedback from my usability testing, I also conducted a preference test to see which version of the home screen participants preferred. All of 
                    them preferred the alternate version. This was an excellent reminder to put my personal tastes aside and keep my users front and center.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01"> 
                    Collecting constructive criticism was another important part of the process. Asking other UX-minded peers gave me ideas on ways to improve the app in 
                    future iterations. For example, one peer wondered what would motivate an Expert to be listed as an Expert and answer the users’ questions. Since Experts 
                    would also be users for my app, their experience should also be taken into account.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01"> 
                    I would also like to increase the accessibility of the app, especially for older users. My app was geared towards anyone living in a permanent dwelling. Therefore, 
                    older users who may be less tech-savvy and/or be more impaired need to have their needs addressed as well.</span>
