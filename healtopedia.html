                  Through my initial research, a significant insight emerged: integrating Healtopedia with popular calendar apps like Google Calendar or iCalendar presents an opportunity to streamline the process for users managing their booking and selecting suitable healthcare services. Currently, users need to manually add their booking details to both Healtopedia and their personal calendars for each doctor's visit, leading to unnecessary duplication of effort.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">
                    By seamlessly synchronizing the appointments entered in Healtopedia with their Google Calendars or iCalendars, users can save time and enhance scheduling efficiency. This solution aligns with the broader objectives of addressing Malaysia's low health literacy, empowering users to make informed healthcare decisions, and mitigating the limitations faced by existing online healthcare providers.
