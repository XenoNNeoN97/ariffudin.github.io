                    <span class="card-subtitle01">CHAT is a mobile messaging app that combines design convenience with a modern visual appearance and a straightforward user path. To help streamline the UI design process, the app was created utilising UI Tool Kits. This was a practise in producing professional-quality work under time constraints.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">My goal for this project was to create a communication app that felt very familiar to users so that they could rapidly establish conversations, contacts, and group chats. I wanted the app's focus to be on conversing with friends and family, rather than learning how to utilise the programme.
               </span>

                    <img src="./assets/images/Chat02.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <span class="card-subtitle02">For this project, I focused on user flows, sketching, wireframing, and prototyping.</span>

                <div class="section-subtitle-container01">
                    <h5 class="title section-subtitle">Wireframe</h5>
                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">I skipped the initial sketching and user testing phases of the design process because this was a short project and I was just charged with producing the app's completed screen design. Instead, I launched Figma and began creating digital mid-fidelity wireframes.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I've used a variety of messaging applications in the past, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, and iMessage, so I had a basic grasp of how these apps were designed and the overall user path. For the app keyboard, I was able to use Apple's UI tool set.
                </span>
                <div class="card-image01">
                    <img src="./assets/images/Chat03.png" alt="">

                    <h5 class="title section-subtitle">Finished Screen</h5>
                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">Because I was tasked with leveraging UI tool kits and reusing existing UI elements to expedite the design process, certain sections of the completed CHAT screens may resemble other designs I've developed. For example, the search and settings icons were generated in Adobe Illustrator for past projects, and the keyboard comes from an Apple iOS 14 UI tool kit.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">Despite the brief, I have attempted to use existing elements as little as possible since I want each of my designs to seem distinct. For the same reason, I felt CHAT should have a darker colour palette to set it apart from previous works.
                </span>

                <div class="card-image01">
                  <img src="./assets/images/Chat05.png" alt="">

                </div>
              
                <span class="card-subtitle01">After finalising the screen designs, I created a number of professional mockups in Figma to better showcase the designs. This includes several presentation pieces using the iPhone's displays. There were also a few real-world instances of the CHAT app in action.

                <span class="card-subtitle01">After finalising the screen designs I made a handful of professional 
                  mockups using Figma to best display the designs. This included some presentation pieces with the 
                  screens displayed on the iPhone. There was also a couple of real world examples of the CHAT app 
                  being used.</span>

                </div>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">My first goal for this project was to create a messaging software that felt natural in the user's hand. The app had to be constructed using UI toolkits and existing UI components that I had created.
                </span>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">In both of these areas, I believe the CHAT app has been a success. Anyone who has used previous messaging applications, even with minimal experience, should be able to browse and utilise the app's capabilities with ease.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">CHAT was also developed using the usage of existing UI elements and UI tool kits, which sped up the whole design process because I no longer had to construct everything from scratch.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I'm quite satisfied with this job, and I believe I've created a collection of high-quality screen designs.
