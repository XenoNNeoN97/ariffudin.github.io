                    <span class="card-subtitle01">CHAT is a mobile messenger app which combines design familiarity with a 
                        sleek visual aesthetic and simple user path. The app was designed using UI Tool Kits to help streamline 
                        the UI design process. This was an exercise in learning how to produce professional standard work under 
                        time pressure. </span>

                </div>

                <span class="card-subtitle02">With a focus on UI for this project, the steps I covered in my 
                    design process included user flows, sketching, wireframing, style guides, and prototyping.</span>


                <div class="section-subtitle-container01">
                    <h5 class="title section-subtitle">Objective</h5>
                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">My objective for this project was to produce a message app that 
                    felt very familiar to users so they could quickly start conversation, and contacts and group
                    chats. I wanted the focus of the app to be chatting with friends and family, not figure out 
                    how to use the software.
                </span>

                <div class="section-subtitle-container01">
                    <h5 class="title section-subtitle">Wireframe</h5>
                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">As this was a mini project and i was tasked to only produce the app's 
                    finished screen design, i bypassed the inital sketching and user testing portion of the design 
                    process. Insted, i open Figma and began working on the digital mid-fidelity wireframes.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I've used a number of messager apps in the past such WhatsApp, Telegram,
                    Slack and iMessage, so i had a good understanding of how these types of apps were designed and 
                    the general user journey. I was able to use Apple's UI tool kit for the app keyboard.
                </span>

                    <img src="./assets/images/Chat03.png" alt="">

                    <h5 class="title section-subtitle">Style Guide</h5>
                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">I then figured out the essential features the app would need to 
                    make it successful and useful. I also created a user flow diagram to map out these features 
                    and see what kind of pages would be necessary for the app.</span>

                <div class="section-subtitle-container01">
                    <h5 class="title section-subtitle">Finished Screen</h5>
                </div>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">As I was tasked with using UI tool kits and resuing existing UI 
                  elements, to speed up the design process, some parts of the finished CHAT screens may appear
                  similar to other designs I have created. For instance Iam reusing the seearch and settings
                  icons I created in Adobe Illustrator for previous projects and the keyboard is from an Apple
                  iOS 14 UI tool kit.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">However, despite the brief I have tried to keep using existing
                  element to a minimum as I want each of my designs to feel unique. For this same reason I 
                  decided CHAT should have a darker colour palette to differentiate in from other piece of work.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">After finalising the screen designs I made a handful of professional 
                  mockups using Figma to best display the designs. This included some presentation pieces with the 
                  screens displayed on the iPhone. There was also a couple of real world examples of the CHAT app 
                  being used.</span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">The best way for any user to gain an understanding of a design is for them 
                  to engage with the product themselve. Using Figma prototyping feature I produced a working prototype of 
                  the CHAT app which allows people to experience it first hand.

                    <h5 class="title section-subtitle">Summary</h5>
                </div>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">At the beginning of this project my objective was to design a messenger app
                  which felt natural in the user's hand. The app also needed to be designed with the use of UI tool kits 
                  and existing UI elements I had produced.
                </span>
                
                <span class="card-subtitle01">I belive the CHAT app has been a success in both of the above areas. Anyone 
                  who has used other messenger apps, even with very limited experince, should quite easily navigate the app 
                  and use its features.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">CHAT has also been designed with the use of existing UI elements and UI elements
                  and UI tool kits, which did speed up the overall design process as I no longer had to create everything from 
                  scratch.
                </span>

                <span class="card-subtitle01">I'm very pleased with this project and I think I have produced a set of high-quality
                  scrreen designs.
